Question 1

###1a
>How does HTTP support the caching of web pages?


###1b
>Explain why HTML elements have both an *id* attribute and a *class* attribute.

In HTML, the *class* attribute can be used repeatedly to mark an element which is to share the same features as defined in a cascading style sheet. The *id* element is used as a unique identifier for elements such as naming text fields. 

###1c
>What is the purpose of the CSS specification?

The W3C specification is designed to create a standard for writing CSS by defining the syntax and element names when writing CSS code. 

###1d
>Describe the key features of CSS.


CSS or Cascading Style Sheets add semantic content to plain XML documents. Where XML describes data types, CSS adds visual content to this information to be rendered in a browser. 

By referencing an element, id or class and adding a style, XML documents can be made much more human readable without altering the underlying model.

###1e
>Design a stylesheet so that the template html page below floats the sidebar to the right hand side of the page with a 2 pixel border, and has the navigation list inline, with the here item's background in red, and turns the background of the anchors in the navigation list to grey when the mouse is over them.

    #sidebar {
		float: right;
		border: 2px;
	}

	#navigation {
		display: inline;
	}
	
	.here {
		background: red;
	}

	#navigation a:hover {
		background-color: grey;
	}

Question 3

###3a

>"HTTP is a stateless protocol". Explain what is meant by this statement.

This statement means that no data is stored between requests. When a HTTP request is made, it must be made in full each time as no data is saved from previous requests. This means that there is often redundancy between HTTP requests but is it reliable because the format of the request is always the same regardless of previous requests. 

###3b
>How are sessions supported over HTTP?

HTTP doesn't support sessions itself, but it uses cookies?

###3c

#####i)
>What is the purpose of the session_start function call?

To create a session that is unique to this user.

#####ii)
If the number variable has a value in the address bar (`GET` request), http://www.something.com/file.php?number=3 then a query is made to a mysqlite database where a the from a database of exams is returned where the id matches `number`. The list of returned named is iterated over and displayed in an unordered list. 

#####iii)
>What are the security problems in this code?

The input allows for SQL injection. PHP magic quotes should fix this, or sanitise the input by validating it and only allowing numbers using a the regular expression `/[0-9]*/`
